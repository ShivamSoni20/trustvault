Hint: what's next?
Once you are ready to write TypeScript unit tests for your contract, run the following command:

  $ npm install
  $ npm test
    Run all run tests in the ./tests folder.

Find more information on testing with Clarinet here: https://docs.hiro.so/stacks/clarinet-js-sdk
These hints can be disabled in the ~/.clarinet/clarinetrc.toml file.
  $ mkdir -p ~/.clarinet; echo "enable_hints = false" >> ~/.clarinet/clarinetrc.toml
